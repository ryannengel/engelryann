        <p class="about-art">Our class were asked to create a product and manufacturing company from scratch. Above is the product I created; "Sorry Mom Tattoo Ink". In addition to multiple logos we were asked to create packaging design for the container and the box in which it would be sold, an ad for the product and a full write up on the product and its company.</p>
